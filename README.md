Predict Locations of Facial Keypoints
=====================================

This is a repository to exhibit my submission to [kaggle's facial keypoints detection competition](http://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection). Code files for my solutions are in the `./scripts` directory. 

###Running Locally

To run these scripts locally, download all the [data](http://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data) provided on kaggle and save it in the raw directory. The file `'./scripts/import.R'` will import the data and save the data frames as `.Rdata` files.

###My Progress
Track my progress me on the [leaderboard](http://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/leaderboard), or visit my [profile](http://www.kaggle.com/users/170251/andrew-linville).
